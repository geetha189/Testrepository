GitHub--githib commands and purpose


there is no testing we don;t do it test team will take care

we do unit testing  nothing but while dwritng the logis to work some functioning for the valid inout we test it by default we write with code 
Example:
textbox for phone number, whli submitting the form there should be numbers in the textbox  else form won't go for submission for 
that we have to test is it valid code to reach that requirement

latest devops 
we push the code into GITHIB there it will automatically send the logfie to us if there is erros or success then
 we have to recheck the error and again we have chak the code

some other projrcts
we push the code into github and the testing team will sent the code back to us incase of erros

debugging the code techniques
1) we put the debugger in the code 
2)we directly go the developer console there we can go to spurces and keep the break point

CSS design checking
we do toincept element and there we can chang the designe related values just for
 testing only it wont be  change not reflected in your html page after testing you can edit the code in the orginal file where we wrtit eht code
